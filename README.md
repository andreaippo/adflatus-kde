# About  
The KDE Plasma desktop uses the "Breeze" style by default. 
The translated meaning of "Adflatus" is "breath" or "breeze". 
I use it as "boring" default color scheme for my KDE setup.
It is basically a forked Breeze theme with some adaptations.

When I developed Adflatus, I wanted it to function similarily to how "Material You" behaves.
It's supposed to be good looking under all conditions, no matter which dominant color you prefer. It especially shines with the "Choose accent color based on wallpaper"-function.

# Styles
I made two variants for now. One poster child, one for accessibility.

**Default**
  It's better looking, with lower contrasts and an uniform background. It's more modern, but not as easy on the eyes.  
  
**Higher contrast**
  This one has increased contrasts and easier accessibility, on the cost of some minor aesthetic drawbacks.
  For example, I couldn't make the title bar "flat", because if I did, the contrast in the list view would have gone missing.
  
**Light**
  Light theme, that doesn't burn your eyes. More greyish than other light styles, but just as adaptive as the dark version.
