# About  
The KDE Plasma desktop uses the "Breeze" style by default. 
The translated meaning of "Adflatus" is "breath" or "breeze". 
I use it as "boring" default color scheme for my KDE setup.  

When I developed Adflatus, I wanted it to function similarily to how "Material You" behaves.
It's supposed to be good looking under all conditions, no matter which dominant color you prefer. It especially shines with the "Choose accent color based on wallpaper"-function.  

# Styles
I made two variants for now. One poster child, one for accessibility.
## Default
It's better looking, with lower contrasts and an uniform background. It's more modern, but not as easy on the eyes.  
## Higher contrast
This one has increased contrasts and easier accessibility, on the cost of some minor aesthetic drawbacks.
For example, I couldn't make the title bar "flat", because if I did, the contrast in the list view would have gone missing.
## [WIP] Highest contrast, easy on eyes.
Inspired by [Optimal](https://github.com/MilesBHuff/Optimality-Theme). Largely reduced eye strain.
## Light
I didn't have the need for it yet, but I can design a light color scheme too if there's demand.
